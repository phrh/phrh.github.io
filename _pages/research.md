## Single-cell size dynamics
Imagine a single cell growing at a given rate and then, suddenly out of blue, it divides its size in two. Is this random? is there an internal clock, a size sensing mechanisms or any control that fires such abrupt change? Our team study the division phenomena through the following partial differential equation (PDE)

$$\frac{\partial p\left(z, t \mid y, t^{\prime}\right)}{\partial t}=- \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left [ \alpha \,z\, p\left(z, t \mid y, t^{\prime}\right)\right]+2\, k\, z \,p\left(2z, t \mid y, t^{\prime}\right)-k\, z\,p\left(z, t \mid y, t^{\prime}\right)$$
