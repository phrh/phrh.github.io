I am a bioinformatician. I have a background in electronic engineering and a profound interest in biology. Since 2015, I have been working in the agriculture and livestock sector. 

I have developed computational tools to predict associations in genomic data on algorithms for post-transcriptional gene regulation, genotyping and variant detection, and genotype and phenotype association. In 2015 I joined AGROSAVIA, and I have worked first at the Colombian National Germplasm Bank in the information system and second on a Genotyping platform for the Bank. Currently, I am working on plant genome assembly. 

Even though my main interests are in agrigenomics and studying Colombian diversity, I also look forward to integrating information technologies (including AI) into the Colombian agricultural sector.
